## This project uses MySQL & Node.js to create a online storefront that allows users and managers to view and update products.

## Notes:

- I got started on the second level of the assignment, which provides a manger view and allows the user to update inventory quantities and add new products. This part is still unfinished.

- I used dotenv to store the MySQL password in an environment variable.
